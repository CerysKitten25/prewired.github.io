### Past Events

**4th March 2015 - Beginners Android Development**

Learn the basics of how to make your first Android app with members of Scotland's largest mobile app development agency, [Kotikan](http://kotikan.com). Over the course of the evening we'll introduce key concepts required to create an Android app and work with you as you build your own simple product.

Before you come, if possible, install the following on your laptop (follow the links for instructions):

* [Android Studio and the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)
* [GenyMotion](https://www.genymotion.com) (plugin to Android studio)

*No prior experience with Android or Java necessary! (But it also won't hurt)*
