### Events

As well as our weekly sessions, we hold special one-off or annually repeating events. If you know of an event you'd like to take part in with Prewired's help, please let us know!

### Workshops

**<span class="color1 wee">* new!</span> 4th March 2015 - Beginners Android Development**

Learn the basics of how to make your first Android app with members of Scotland's largest mobile app development agency, [Kotikan](http://kotikan.com). Over the course of the evening we'll introduce key concepts required to create an Android app and work with you as you build your own simple product.

Before you come, if possible, install the following on your laptop (follow the links for instructions):

* [Android Studio and the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)
* [GenyMotion](https://www.genymotion.com) (plugin to Android studio)

*No prior experience with Android or Java necessary! (But it also won't hurt)*

**Registration:** Just sign up and come along as you usually do, no special notice necessary. If you want to come to Prewired but don't fancy Android development you can still come along and do what you normally do!

Annually we send teams to [the Young Rewired State Festival of Code](http://www.yrs.io) in July/August.
