### Events

As well as our weekly sessions, we hold special one-off or annually repeating events. If you know of an event you'd like to take part in with Prewired's help, please let us know!

### Ongoing

#### <span class="btn-big inner lighter color1-bg">Maker Week</span> 13th - 17th April, 12-4pm

This is Prewired every day! Come to **CodeBase** for as many or as few days as you like during this week. Our mentors will be around to help you work on whatever cool project you like. A great chance to start and finish something in one week!

**To sign up:**

* [Make sure you're registered as a member](/membership.html) so we have your emergency contact details.
* [Sign up for the days/times you will attend here](http://doodle.com/cakheiix3min7is9). It's public so you can see when your friends will be there too (in case you want to work on something together) but if you'd rather not post for all to see, then email hello@prewired.org with the days you'd like to come.
* Make sure you're signed up for the [newsletter](#newsletter) for any updates.

**What to bring:**

* Your laptop or other hardware you'd like to work with (we'll have the usual spares).
* A packed lunch if you'd like something to eat. We'll have a few snacks and juice, but not proper lunch.
* Excitement and enthusiasm!

#### <span class="btn-big inner lighter color2-bg">Mini Maker Faire</span> 19th April, 10-5pm

The [Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfaireedinburgh.com/) is an event in **Summerhall**, Edinburgh, on Sunday 19th April. We'll have a table to show off the variety of interesting projects that happen at Prewired, both things created during the Maker Week, and anything else cool that you've worked on - maybe a website, game, hardware project, or anything else. 

**To sign up:**

* Think of the project(s) you'd like to show. What do you need to be able to share it with other people? You could make a poster or a video, or just demo it directly!
* [Fill in this form](#) to let us know what you need and what you will bring, and what time you can be there. We'll have our table all day, but you don't have to stay the whole time (you can leave your poster/project/demo with us if you like of course).
* Show up at the time you said you would, on Sunday 19th! Bring your excitement.

If you stay to show something at the Prewired table for an hour or more, you get free entry to the Maker Faire (as 'crew'). When you're done (or before) you can spend as much time looking around all of the other awesome stuff at the Faire as you like! If you want to bring parents/siblings/friends, they'll have to buy a ticket on the Maker Faire website.

If you have any questions, hello@prewired.org.

### Past Events

**4th March 2015 - Beginners Android Development**

Learn the basics of how to make your first Android app with members of Scotland's largest mobile app development agency, [Kotikan](http://kotikan.com). Over the course of the evening we'll introduce key concepts required to create an Android app and work with you as you build your own simple product.

Before you come, if possible, install the following on your laptop (follow the links for instructions):

* [Android Studio and the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)
* [GenyMotion](https://www.genymotion.com) (plugin to Android studio)

*No prior experience with Android or Java necessary! (But it also won't hurt)*
