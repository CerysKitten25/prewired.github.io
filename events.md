#### <span class="btn-big inner lighter color1-bg">Young Rewired State</span>  27th July - 3rd August

**See [PreWired YRS 2015 Edinburgh](http://www.prewired.org/yrs15) for details!**

Annually we send teams to [the Young Rewired State Festival of Code](http://www.yrs.io) in the last week of July. This involves working in teams or individually on a single project, for four days at your local centre (put Edinburgh when you sign up and you'll be allocated to Prewired), then a trip for the weekend to the final competition in Birmingham, where hundreds participants from all over the UK gather to present their projects, meet other like-minded young people, have fun and win prizes!

It's free, and Prewired should be teaming up with other Scottish centres to run a coach to Birmingham.

Sign up as a participant or mentor on the [YRS website](http://festival.yrs.io)

### Past Events

**13th-17th April 2015 - Maker Week**

Prewired every day! Mentors were around to help Prewired participants work on whatever cool project they wanted, and there were some great outcomes! [A note about it on Amy's blog](http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/04/prewired-maker).

**19th April 2015 - Mini Maker Faire**

The [Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfaireedinburgh.com/) was an event in **Summerhall**, Edinburgh, on Sunday 19th April. We had a table to show off the variety of interesting projects that happen at Prewired. Kids attended as 'crew' to show off their work and tell people about Prewired. They did an amazing job!

**4th March 2015 - Beginners Android Development**

Learn the basics of how to make your first Android app with members of Scotland's largest mobile app development agency, [Kotikan](http://kotikan.com). Over the course of the evening we'll introduce key concepts required to create an Android app and work with you as you build your own simple product.

Before you come, if possible, install the following on your laptop (follow the links for instructions):

* [Android Studio and the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)
* [GenyMotion](https://www.genymotion.com) (plugin to Android studio)

*No prior experience with Android or Java necessary! (But it also won't hurt)*
