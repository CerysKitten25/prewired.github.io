### Events

As well as our weekly sessions, we hold special one-off or annually repeating events. If you know of an event you'd like to take part in with Prewired's help, please let us know!

### Ongoing

#### Maker Week, 13th - 17th April, 12-4pm

This is Prewired every day! Come to **CodeBase** for as many or as few days as you like during this week. Our mentors will be around to help you work on whatever cool project you like. A great chance to start and finish something in one week!

**To sign up:**

* [Make sure you're registered as a member](/membership.html) so we have your emergency contact details.
* [Sign up for the days/times you will attend here](http://doodle.com/cakheiix3min7is9). It's public so you can see when your friends will be there too (in case you want to work on something together) but if you'd rather not post for all to see, then email hello@prewired.org with the days you'd like to come.
* Make sure you're signed up for the [newsletter](#newsletter) for any updates.

**What to bring:**

* Your laptop or other hardware you'd like to work with (we'll have the usual spares).
* A packed lunch if you'd like something to eat. We'll have a few snacks and juice, but not proper lunch.
* Excitement and enthusiasm!

#### Mini Maker Faire, 19th April

The [Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfaireedinburgh.com/) is an event in Edinburgh around easter time. We'll have a table to show off the variety of interesting projects that happen at Prewired. If you're interested and have something to show - maybe a website, game, hardware project, or anything else - talk to Eder at any Prewired session, or drop an email to hello@prewired.org. We'll be actively recruiting for projects very soon...

#### Google Science Fair

We're entering teams into the [Google Science Fair](https://www.googlesciencefair.com). To take part, head to the 'Science Fair' labelled table at Prewired on 11th March! (And read the Science Fair website for more info).

### Past Events

**4th March 2015 - Beginners Android Development**

Learn the basics of how to make your first Android app with members of Scotland's largest mobile app development agency, [Kotikan](http://kotikan.com). Over the course of the evening we'll introduce key concepts required to create an Android app and work with you as you build your own simple product.

Before you come, if possible, install the following on your laptop (follow the links for instructions):

* [Android Studio and the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)
* [GenyMotion](https://www.genymotion.com) (plugin to Android studio)

*No prior experience with Android or Java necessary! (But it also won't hurt)*
