                        <h3>Prewired every day: <br/>28th July to 3rd August</h3>
                        <p>The Young Rewired State (YRS) Festival of Code is an annual celebration of everything code for those aged 18 and under. It occurs in regional centres <em>all over the UK</em> every year, and ends with a long weekend where everybody comes together, showcasing the amazing achievements created during the week.</p>
                        <p><em>Monday - Thursday:</em> Come to Appleton Tower as usual, 10am - 4pm, every day. Lunch provided (but feel free to bring your own)!</p>
                        <p><em>Friday:</em> Travel to Plymouth to meet all the other coders.</p>
                        <p><em>Saturday - Sunday:</em> Finish your projects, have fun, present, win prizes!</p>
                        <h3>Going to Plymouth</h3>
                        <p>We realise Plymouth is pretty far, but we can promise you (from previous years) it's totally worth it! You can finish your projects in a great atmosphere, surrounded by other coders, and then present to judges who are usually famous names in the computing world. So you can get the most out of the week, Prewired want to make it as easy as possible for many of you to come down to Plymouth:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Figure out how you'd prefer to get there. We've listed the best <a href="#travel">travel options</a> we can find for you.</li>
                            <li>Book your travel. 13s and under <em>must</em> bring a parent or guardian. (If you can't pay your travel costs up front, <a href="mailto: hello@prewired.org">contact us</a>).</li>
                            <li>Submit your travel costs to us before the 1st of July, and Prewired will <em>pay them back to you</em> when we're all back from Plymouth (<a href="#tc">conditions apply.. please read them!</a>).</li>
                            <li>For those who don't wish to travel alone, tell us your plans and we will arrange mentors to accompany you, or put you in contact with others planning the same journey.</li>
                            <li>At Plymouth University we'll all meet up and <em>free accommodation</em> is provided for Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>But if that's not enough to convince you, you can still take part in the rest of the week in Edinburgh even if you can't come to Plymouth at the weekend, and you should still <a href="https://youngrewiredstate.org/events/gb/2014/festival-of-code/signup">register on the YRS website</a>. </p>
                        <h3 id="travel">Travel options</h3>
                        <p>You need to arrive in Plymouth on Friday 1st August, and depart on Monday 4th (us northerners get an extra night accommodation free! If you need to leave on Sunday, you'll probably have to miss the end of the Festival).</p>
                        <p>Note: The later you leave it, the more expensive things become and the fewer time options for flights are available.</p>
                        <p class="upp">&gt; &gt; Via London</p>
                        <p><em>This is our favourite at the moment. YRS coaches can pick you up from a London airport, and take us all to Plymouth together if we arrive at similar times into the same place.</em></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fly Edinburgh - Heathrow, Virgin Atlantic flight leaves at 1320, arriving in London 1450.</li>
                            <li>A YRS coach/minibus will pick you up from the airport and drive to Plymouth: £35 return and must be booked through YRS (booking available after 1st July).</li>
                            <li>The coach will return you on Monday 4th in time for your return flight. We recommend the Virign Atlantic flight that leaves Heathrow at 1625, arriving in Edinburgh at 1745.</li>
                            <li>The actual flight times and airports you choose are up to you - but you need to let us know which airports and what time for us to be able to arrange the coaches to Plymouth! Do so <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1c3AAJTQw-gKFCoPrTkgwLwKI_hj9I8BE3uNj9nvWTyQ/viewform">with this form</a> by <strong>1st July</strong>.
