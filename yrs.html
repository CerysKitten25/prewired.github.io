                        <h3>Prewired every day: <br/>28th July to 3rd August</h3>
                        <p>The Young Rewired State (YRS) Festival of Code is an annual celebration of everything code for those aged 18 and under. It occurs in regional centres <em>all over the UK</em> every year, and ends with a long weekend where everybody comes together, showcasing the amazing achievements created during the week.</p>
                        <p><em>Monday - Thursday:</em> Come to Appleton Tower as usual, 10am - 4pm, every day. Lunch provided (but feel free to bring your own)!</p>
                        <p><em>Friday:</em> Travel to Plymouth to meet all the other coders.</p>
                        <p><em>Saturday - Sunday:</em> Finish your projects, have fun, present, win prizes!</p>
                        <h3>Going to Plymouth</h3>
                        <p>We realise Plymouth is pretty far, but we can promise you (from previous years) it's totally worth it! You can finish your projects in a great atmosphere, surrounded by other coders, and then present to judges who are usually famous names in the computing world. So you can get the most out of the week, Prewired want to make it as easy as possible for many of you to come down to Plymouth:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Figure out how you'd prefer to get there. We've listed the best <a href="#travel">travel options</a> we can find for you.</li>
                            <li>Book your travel. 13s and under <em>must</em> bring a parent or guardian. (If you can't pay your travel costs up front, <a href="mailto: hello@prewired.org">contact us</a>).</li>
                            <li>Submit your travel costs to us before the 1st of July, and Prewired will <em>pay them back to you</em> when we're all back from Plymouth (<a href="#tc">conditions apply</a>).</li>
                            <li>For those who don't wish to travel alone, tell us your plans and we will arrange mentors to accompany you, or put you in contact with others planning the same journey.</li>
                            <li>At Plymouth University we'll all meet up and <em>free accommodation</em> is provided for Friday and Saturday night.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>But if that's not enough to convince you, you can still take part in the rest of the week in Edinburgh even if you can't come to Plymouth at the weekend, and you should still <a href="https://youngrewiredstate.org/events/gb/2014/festival-of-code/signup">register on the YRS website</a>. </p>

                        <p>You need to arrive in Plymouth on Friday 1st August, and depart on Sunday 3rd, ideally after 5pm.
