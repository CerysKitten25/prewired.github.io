### Child protection policy

All mentors must sign to agree to our child protection policy.

#### Code of Conduct

* All children, parents and volunteers are treated with respect and courtesy; exclusion, bullying, disrespect or abuse will not be tolerated.
* Mentors, participants or parents noticing anything wrong or with any concerns should report them to the Duty Mentor who will take appropriate action.

#### Registration

* All bookings must be made through [Eventbrite or the membership form](membership.html) and each arriving participant will be signed in and out of the venue from the booking list.
* Each parent or participant much fill include emergency contact details and any known illnesses, allergies or special requirements in the registration form. An assigned party will be made aware of these details each week.

#### Supervision

* Prewired is attended by mentors from local universities, companies and community groups. A majority of mentors have Disclosure.
* Prewired session activities are confined to a single open space and no child will be unsupervised at any time.
* Parents must accompany younger children (under 10).
* New attendees are met and welcomed by a mentor who will help them to get started on a project that interests them.
* All attendees are made aware of how mentors may be identified and who is the Duty Mentor (main contact for the week).
* Younger children wishing to use the toilets in Appleton Tower or Codebase must be accompanied by the duty mentor to the appropriate landing. Mentors do not enter the toilet with the child. If more than one child the mentor waits for all children before returning to the Prewired room.
* Any problems not involving coding (e.g being unwell or upset) are dealt with by the duty mentor.
* Mentors will monitor the activities of children working independently to ensure they are not accessing inappropriate online content.
* At least two mentors will remain at the venue until all children have been collected by guardians or left to go home at the end of the session.

#### Mentors

* Interested volunteers must attend a group first and talk to existing senior mentors before being accepted as a volunteer.
* Mentors must be registered in our database. 
* Mentors must be identifiable to parents and children by wearing the mentor tshirt or lanyard.
* The Duty Mentor is nominated for each session and must be Disclosed.
* A majority of mentors have Disclosure.

#### Communications

* The Prewired Facebook page, Google Group and IRC channel are only open to participants, parents and known mentors. The Facebook page and Google Group are moderated, and the IRC channel is password-protected.
* Mentors are instructed not to communicate with participants in private email messages, but through the public/moderated communications mechanisms above.

#### Other

* Snacks provided at each session may include crisps, biscuits, fruit, nuts and fruit juice. There will be no fizzy/sugary drinks, energy drinks, alcohol or sweets, or things that could constitute a full meal. Mentors are instructed to not share food with participants which has not been provided by Prewired.
