## How to join

1. You or a parent sign up for the newsletter using the form below, so you don't miss out on any announcements.
2. Register for the first week you'd like to attend on Eventbrite, leaving your emergency contact details and any special requirements.
3. Turn up!
    - If you have never coded before, or have but don't know what to do, no problem! Introduce yourself to the Duty Mentor (who should be easy to spot) when you arrive, and they'll help you to get started.
    - If you're already working on a coding project (maybe you're building your own website), or learning a topic by yourself and are happy to carry on with that, cool beans. Make yourself at home and ask any of our mentors if you need help (they'll be wearing special tshirts, or you can put your hand up and someone will spot you).

## When and where?

- Find us every Wednesday between 5:30 and 7:30pm in CodeBase.
- Sign in (tick your name off the list) at the main entrance, then follow the signs to the room.

## What to bring

- If you can bring your own laptop, please do! But if you need to borrow one, we have a few spares - just ask a mentor.
- If you have any other hardware or special equipment you'd like to use, feel free to bring that too. There's likely to be someone around who can help you get it working.
- We'll provide some snacks, but you can bring your own if you like.
- Enthusiasm! Whether you know everything or nothing at all, all you need is to be excited about making something cool with computers. If you have ideas about what you'd like to do but don't know how to do it you should let someone know!

## Keeping in touch

If you want to chat to other members in-between sessions, you can:

- Request to join the mailing list: prewired-discuss@googlegroups.com
- Join the facebook group.
- Join the IRC channel (ask a mentor for the password).

Watch this space... Soon we'll have our very own social network which you can use to blog about your projects or chat to other members in your own private space.

# Mentors

We're always looking for more helpers!

Helping young people learn to code is hugely rewarding. If you can offer your time for two hours at 5.30pm on a Wednesday evening, we'd love to hear from you! We'd prefer it if you drop us an email before showing up, so we know who to expect - hello [at] prewired [dot] org. 

## How we teach

Prewired is largely unstructured and our main goal is to support the young people in learning whatever it is they want to learn. So mentoring at Prewired consists mostly of wandering around a room full of budding hackers, answering questions, helping to fix bugs, and actively checking on the kids to make sure they're happy and learning.

Any and all software and hardware skills are welcome! At present we have young people working with:

Python basics
Python games
Front-end web development
Scratch
Minecraft mods
C++
Java
Lego Mindstorms
Raspberry Pi
Arduinos

We don't necessarily always have mentors to cover all of these, so if you know anything about these topics... please get in touch! If you have different expertise you'd like to bring, that's also very welcome. We have new attendees all the time, and it's hard to predict what they'll want to learn about next.

## Workshops

From time to time we hold a more structured workshop about a specific topic, and encourage all of the young people to get involved and learn something they might not otherwise have thought about. If you'd like to run a workshop we'd love to have you - just get in touch.

## Certifications and qualifications

Currently volunteering at Prewired doesn't qualify you for any specific awards (except for massive kudos and great experience and references for the CV). However, we're interested in improving your experience however we can, so if you know of a scheme you think we'd fit into that will help you to earn something more, please let us know.

### Disclosure (aka CRB checking)

We work with the STEM Ambassador Programme to organise Disclosure for our mentors free of charge. This can be very useful for you if you wish to work with children or vulnerable people in other contexts too. We periodically arrange sessions when there's enough interest, and we're keen to have Disclosure for as many of our mentors as possible.

## On your first day

The first time you come to a session, please introduce yourself to the Duty Mentor and remind them who you are and what topics you're able to help with. 

You'll be asked to read our [child protection guidelines](#) and sign your acknowledgement of them. You'll also be asked to fill out your details for the [mentors database](#) so we can keep in touch with you and keep track of the skills we have floating around the room (you can ask us to remove you from this at any time, if you decide to stop coming).

Sometimes it can be hard to get stuck in, so [here are some guidelines for effective mentoring](#guidelines).

## Ongoing participation

You don't need to come every week, but it's helpful for the kids to have some consistency, so we'd love it if you could come as often as possible. If you do become a regular, please join the prewired-helpers@googlegroups.com mailing list, where we post special announcements, meetings/programmes/events/opportunities that might interest mentors, and occasional reminders about sessions. You can also use this list to chat to other mentors and ask questions.

Mentors who have undergone Disclosure can take a turn at being the Duty Mentor. We rotate this each week between people happy to do it, and it's mostly just about being the first port of call for kids, parents and other mentors. You can see the [Duty Mentor guidelines and rota here](#). 

## Organising and outreach

If you're interested in getting more involved in the organising side of things, let us know that too! If you have any specific qualifications, skills or experience (eg. in education, child services, first-aid, accounting...) don't forget to mention that.

## Mentors guidelines

* what not to feed kids
* how to check up on kids
* what to teach kids
* communications guidelines
* child protection

## Duty Mentor guidelines and rota

We hope that everyone who has undergone Disclosure is happy to be on the rota for Duty Mentor, but if you'd really rather not be, just us know. We generate the rota two weeks in advance, so please let us know immediately if you're not going to be here that week so we can replace you. We'll remind you by email, too.

It's really no big deal, and it's a huge help to us if you take a turn. Here's what you need to do:

*responsibilities/guidelines*

# Parents

Parents and guardians, you are welcome, but not obliged, to accompany your child to a Prewired session if you think this would benefit them. They will otherwise be fully supervised at all times by volunteers from local community groups, companies and universities.

## [Why] Should my child come to Prewired?

If your child has shown an interest in learning to code, or just always seems to be on the computer, then they'll probably get a lot out of coming to Prewired. We let the young people guide their own learning, and support them by answering questions and pointing them at the right resources.

We have no lower limit on age or ability, so long as your child is enthusiastic about coding is comfortable learning independently or in a semi-supervised way with a computer. (We don't have the capacity to look after very young children who are not able to engage).

## What do we offer?

Prewired provides an unstructured but **supportive environment** for under 19s to explore and learn about computer programming and related topics.

We have **mentors** from university and industry with a wide variety of skills, volunteer their time, because they love to teach young people about computing. 

Occasionally we run structured **workshops** to introduce attendees to a new topic they may not have considered before. Sometimes we hold **hackathons**, where the kids are challenged to meet specific goals in a set amount of time; this is a really fun learning experience, with concrete outcomes. Sometimes we form teams to take part in national **events** like [the First Lego League](#) or [Young Rewired State](#). You'll hear about these if you sign up to the newsletter.

Prewired is also a place for young people to **meet peers** with shared interests which they can develop together. For some, it can be difficult to interest their friends and family in computing which may be isolating. It can be hard to figure out where to go next when there's no-one you can ask. We want to let young people know that there's a huge **community** of like-minded people who are waiting to welcome them with open arms.

## What does your child need?

If possible, please bring a laptop. We have a few spares, but not many.

If your child has other technological toys they want to tinker with, they can bring them along! (Eg. Raspberry Pis, Arduino kits, Lego Mindstorms).

We'll provide fruit juice and a few snacks half way through the session. If your child wants to bring their own snacks they're welcome to.

## How much does it cost?

Nothing! Prewired is free, run by volunteers, occasionally supported by donations from local companies.

## Membership

For frequent attendees, we offer a long-term membership option. This just means you have to fill out the registration form less frequently, by giving us permission to hold your data on file. You can [sign up here](www.prewired.org/membership).

## Why do we do this?

See the [FAQ](faq#why).

## Child protection

A majority of our mentors have completed [STEM Ambassador](#) training and are [Disclosed](#).

You can read our [child protection policy here](#).

## Any other questions?

Please email hello[at]prewired.org and we'll be happy to answer them.



# Sponsors

[Coder Dojo logo etc]

Prewired is run by volunteers on a shoestring budget. Keeping young people enthused about programming is [really important](faq#why), so if you'd like to help us keep going, read on to find out what we need.

Please email hello[at]prewired.org (or talk to Amy, Rikki or Ewan at TMU Edinburgh - they'll mention Prewired in their intros) if you or the company you work for might be able to help us out with any of the following...

Also, please make sure you're happy with our [sponsors policy](#policy) before you agree to donate anything.

## Equipment

Not all of the young people who come to Prewired can bring their own laptops. We have a few donated spares that attendees can borrow. Does your company have spare or old laptops lying around that could use a good home? Or could you buy us some cheap ones we can put Ubuntu on?

## Catering

Every session we provide juice and light snacks for our attendees to keep them going and let them have a break. Currently volunteers take turns at buying these.

For certain special events and hackathons we'd like to provide light lunch daily.

* £50 (?) per month can cover our snacks overhead.
* £100 (?) can provide light lunch and snacks for 20 kids for one day of a special event.

## Expertise

If you're a company with employees to spare on Wednesday evenings, send them along to CodeBase mentor!

## Transport

Annually we take part in [Young Rewired State](http://www.festivalofco.de), which culminates in a gathering of hundreds of young people at one location in the UK. Depending on where, a coach can cost between £400 and £1000 for the whole group, and we don't want any kids to miss out because they can cover their share.

## Prizes

Sometime we hold special hackathons, usually in the Easter Holidays, and we want to give out small prizes for the projects the young people work on. Nothing expensive, just a token of appreciation. Programming books? A fancy gaming mouse? Geeky tshirts? Suggestions and contributions are very welcome!

## Work Experience

Many of our young people are at secondary school and have mandatory work experience coming up. These usually last one week. Some of the placements can be pretty rubbish. We think it would be really beneficial to be able to send them to a software company rather than something they're not really interested in. Can your company host an enthusiastic young coder for a week in spring/summer? We're building up a database so that we can pair young people with good placements when the time comes.

## Sponsors policy

...following wording borrowed from Code Club's blog post (http://blog.codeclub.org.uk/2014/08/28/how-code-club-is-run-and-our-relationship-with-our-funders/), to adapt...

We are an independent, non-political organisation. All of our views are our own and are neither directed nor constrained by our sponsors. Our sponsors do not influence how Code Club runs as an organisation and have no hand in its management.

We are not under any obligation to endorse any of the products or services of our corporate funders. Where we make recommendations, they are based on merit alone.

We continue to be grateful for any support we have been given, financially or in-kind. Without this we couldn’t continue to offer free after school clubs, improve the quality of our offerings or support our volunteers.

# Events

As well as our weekly sessions, we hold special one-off or annually repeating events.

*Embed OTC for normal sessions.**

# Work experience

Most schools require that pupils do one or two weeks of work experience at some point. We're working with local tech companies so that young coders and computing enthusiasts can do something that is really beneficial to them.

## Pupils...

If you have work experience coming up, and want us to help to find you a technical placement, email hello [at] prewired.org and tell us which school you go to, and the dates of your work experience.

## Companies...

If you're a company and would like to be added to our list of awesome places that will give young people a chance to find out what working in the tech industry is really like, get in touch!

So far, these companies have said they might be able to offer a placement to young people. They can't guarantee it, but they can consider it. If you're interested in doing a placement at one of these, get in touch with Prewired and we'll put you (or your school) in contact with the right person.

## Why do we do this?

Many schools do not yet offer appropriate computing classes, and curricula that do exist can be patchy. The technology industry is an ever growing one, and at the moment there are more software engineering (and similar) jobs in world than there are people qualified to fill them. It would be terrible if gifted and enthusiastic young people were deterred from pursuing computing qualifications and roles because they were never aware of the opportunities available, and it's too important and urgent to wait for schools to catch up.

But learning to code doesn't only qualify you to be a coder. As our world becomes increasingly technologically-oriented, understanding the process of creating the software that powers our daily lives becomes crucial for everyone. Becoming an empowered digital citizen - or professional in another industry - allows people navigate their rights and responsibilities and make informed decisions about the products and services they use, or provide to others.

We think technology can help us towards a better world, but only if future generations understand the opportunities it brings and the impact it can have.
