Annually we send teams to [the Young Rewired State Festival of Code](http://festival.yrs.io) in the last week of July. This involves working in teams or individually on a single project, for five days at your local centre (put Edinburgh when you sign up and you'll be allocated to Prewired), then a trip for the weekend to the final competition in Birmingham, where hundreds participants from all over the UK gather to present their projects, meet other like-minded young people, have fun and win prizes!

#### Edinburgh Centre

**Where?** CodeBase Events Space, 3 Lady Lawson Street.

**When?** 10am to 4pm, Monday 27th - Thursday 30th July. You don't have to be there 100% of the time, but you will definitely get the best results if you can commit to most hours, most days!

**Friday?** We are running a *free* coach to Birmingham (and back on Sunday) for the Festival of Code (sponsored by Tesco Bank and BCS!). We'll need you to confirm you want a seat and if you're bringing a parent. More info about timings to follow.

**Food?** We'll provide snacks during the week, but please bring a packed lunch or money to buy food from nearby shops/cafes.

**Equipment?** We have spare laptops you can borrow, but if you have your own please bring it as we don't have enough for everyone. We also have some Lego Mindstorms and Arduino kit, but do bring your own if you think you'd like to use it.

#### Festival of Code

The Festival of Code is a giant sleepover-style, weekend-long event in a warehouse in Birmingham, complete with free pizza, chiptune and cool tech demos. But importantly, this is when you'll be presenting what you've been working on all week to judges, for which you can win some fantastic prizes! Even more importantly, this is your chance to meet hundreds of other young coders from all over the UK!

**Accommodation:** is 'indoor camping' style for everyone. That means it's free, but bring a sleeping bag and be prepared for the floor! There will be wifi, power and showers available.

**Under 14s** *must* bring a guardian, and will have their own indoor camping space. If you'd rather stay in a hotel you can, but you'll have to cover the cost of this yourself.

**14-17s** will be in a different space, accompanied by CRB-checked centre leads.

**18 year olds** (and non-CRB-checked mentors) will be in their own space.

#### Mentors

If you'd like to help out for the four days in Edinburgh and/or at the Festival of Code in Birmingham, please [sign up](http://festival.yrs.io)! Even if you can only spare a couple of hours during the week, this is really helpful. Non-techncial help, such as generating ideas and preparing for presentations is also very valuable to the kids. You will be suitably rewarded at the end of the week :)
